Daemonize grunt tasks

Getting started
---------------

This plugin requires Grunt

If you haven't used [Grunt][1] before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started][2] guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile][3] as
well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process,
you may install this plugin with this command:

```sh
npm install grunt-daemon --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile
with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-daemon');
```
